Netflix provided a lot of anonymous rating data, and a prediction accuracy bar that is 10% better than what Cinematch can do on the same training data set. (Accuracy is a measurement of how closely predicted ratings of movies match subsequent actual ratings.)


There are 16000 unique movie IDs.
There are 50000 unique user IDs.
There are ratings. Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
There is a date on which the movie is watched by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
